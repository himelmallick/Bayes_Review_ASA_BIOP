# Analysis codes from the Bayesian Nonclinical Biostatistics review paper 

This repository houses the analysis codes described in the Bayesian Nonclinical Biostatistics review paper led by the [Bayesian work stream](https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/ncbwg/ws2) of the [Nonclinical Biostatistics Working Group (NCBWG)](https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/ncbwg/index) of the [ASA Biopharmaceutical Section](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home).

Four pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies ([Eli Lilly](https://www.lilly.com/), [Merck](https://www.merck.com/), [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/), [Biogen](https://www.biogen.com/)) came together to draft this collaborative review article. Each company focused on a specific Bayesian topic with applications in biomarker discovery and early clinical development.
